#Definition of a PGPE Image header to be used by PGPE Hcode when loaded in
#SRAM. Linker script maps this 64 bit image header to an SRAM address starting from
#0xfff20000. Some fields will be populated during Hcode image build activity. Build date,
#version, IVPR address, __system_reset_address are populated during SGPE image build
#process.
